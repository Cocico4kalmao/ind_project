On August 22nd, I decided to spend some time outdoors and went to Zenkovsky Park. This place always attracts with its cozy atmosphere and green alleys.

## What's interesting in the park

The park offers several pleasant areas for recreation:
- **Duck pond** - always something to feed the birds
- **Children's playgrounds** - modern and safe
- **Walking alleys** - well-maintained paths among trees
- **Sports area** - outdoor exercise equipment

## Impressions

I especially liked the peaceful atmosphere - here you can take a break from the city hustle. Local residents often come here with their families, which creates a truly homely environment.

I recommend Zenkovsky Park to everyone who wants to spend time in nature without leaving the city. A great place for a short walk or relaxing with friends.
