Why Markdown for Presentations?
Markdown revolutionizes presentation creation by separating content from design. Write your content in simple text, then let tools handle the styling.

Benefits of Markdown Presentations:
⚡ Lightning fast - No more dragging boxes and clicking buttons

📝 Focus on content - No distractions from design tools

🔄 Version control - Works perfectly with Git

🎨 Consistent styling - Automated formatting across all slides

📱 Multi-format export - PDF, HTML, PowerPoint from one source
