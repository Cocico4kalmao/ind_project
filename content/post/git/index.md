After working with Git daily, I've learned what really matters. Here's the practical knowledge that saves time and prevents errors.

## Why Git Matters

- **Backup**: Never lose working code again
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work together smoothly  
- **Experimentation**: Try new ideas safely in branches

## Most Useful Commands

```bash
# Basic workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message"
git push

# Fix mistakes
git checkout -- file.txt  # Discard changes
git reset HEAD~1         # Undo last commit

# See what's happening
git status
git log --oneline
